# YahtzeeLearning
An algorithmic attempt to make the game of Yahtzee more interesting

How does one characterize the depth of a game? One method, proposed by Lantz et al., attempts to do so by introducing the idea of a strategy ladder: https://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/WS/AAAIW17/paper/download/15142/1478.

Here, I attempt to probe the shape of Yahtzee's strategy ladder via reinforcement learning. Can it be made a bit less steep? That's what I hope to discover.
